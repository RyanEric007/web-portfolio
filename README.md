# Week 5 Guided Assignment  
### Task 2: Write a Project Reflection  

## About This Project  
This portfolio site is a clean, three page setup that shows what I learned with HTML and CSS. The goal was to keep it simple, readable, and responsive without relying on any frameworks. It has the following:  
- [Home Page](https://ryaneric007.github.io/web-portfolio/index.html) that introduces my background and skills.  
- [Projects Page](https://ryaneric007.github.io/web-portfolio/projects.html) that showcases previews of my work.  
- [Contact Page](https://ryaneric007.github.io/web-portfolio/contact.html) that includes a form that’s fully styled and accessible.  

Everything is hosted on GitHub Pages, making it easy to update and share whenever I have a project idea.

## What I Learned  
- I learned how to properly use **divs** to organize sections and structure a page like a professional layout instead of just stacking elements.  
- I got comfortable with **Flexbox and Grid**, and now I can align and size elements cleanly without fighting floats or weird spacing issues.  
- I learned how to **host websites directly on GitHub** which im stil mindblown about. 

## Next Steps  
I plan adding some **JavaScript** to make this site more interactive.e.g., I could set up a lightbox effect on the project images or use smooth transitions when navigating between pages. I’d also want to look into pulling project data dynamically—maybe from a JSON file.
