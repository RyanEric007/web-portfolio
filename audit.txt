Task 1: Design & Usability

1). Is my navigation menu clear and easy to find on every page?
    Yes.
    • Home: Yeah, nav bar’s up top and easy to find.
    • Projects: Same spot, works the same, consistent layout.
    • Contact: Up top too, all links work and match style.

2). Is there a clear visual hierarchy? (e.g., Are <h1> headings obviously more important than <h2> headings?)
    Yes.
    • Home: One main <h1>, then sections use <h2>.
    • Projects: <h1> for page title, <h2> for gallery, clean layout.
    • Contact: <h1> for title, form labels stand out below.

    Yes.
    • Home: Easy to read, dark text on light bg.
    • Projects: Font and spacing look good, easy on the eyes.
    • Contact: Text and labels are clear, good contrast with white form.

Task 2: Accessibility Check

1). Do all <img> tags have appropriate alt text (or empty alt="" if decorative)?
    Yes.
    • Home: No imgs on main content, just text/table.
    • Projects: All imgs have short alt text that fits what they show.
    • Contact: No imgs on this page.

2). On contact.html, are all <label> elements correctly associated with inputs/textarea using for/id?
